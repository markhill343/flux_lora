Hey everyone!

I've been using my downtime before starting my master's thesis to dive into the world of local fine-tuning of generative models. ðŸŽ“ This post is all about **creating LoRAs for product images using Fluxgym**, and I thought it'd be fun to share my journey with you!

## So, What's a LoRA Anyway?

Before we jump in, let's break it down:

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Think of it as a way to fine-tune large models efficiently by adding a small number of trainable parameters. It's like giving your model a quick, focused lesson without having to retrain the whole thing.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting all the parameters of a pre-trained modelâ€”which can be a real time and resource sink.

Basically, **LoRAs let you customize models without the heavy lifting**, making it way more accessible.

## Getting Started: What You'll Need

### Hardware:

- **GPU**: Preferably an NVIDIA GPU with **12GB VRAM** or more.

### Software:

- **Operating System**: **Ubuntu** with **CUDA** and **PyTorch** installed.
- **Fluxgym**: Our main tool for creating LoRAs. Grab it here: [Fluxgym GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cocktailpeanut/fluxgym)
- **Kohya's SD Scripts**: The brains behind Fluxgym's UI. Check them out: [Kohya's SD Scripts GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/tree/sd3)
- **ComfyUI**: For loading the LoRA and generating images afterward. Find it here: [ComfyUI GitHub Repository](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)

### Data:

- **10-30 Images **:

## Step 1: Preparing Your Images

First up, gather images of your product. For the best results:

- **Crop the Images**: Focus on the product itself. **512x512 pixels** works great.
- **Backgrounds**: You can try a clean, consistent background or mix it up with diverse ones. Feel free to experiment and see what works best!

## Step 2: Generating Image Captions

Captions are super important for guiding the model. Here's what you can do:

- **Use the Same Caption**: Fluxgym can handle it if you want to keep things simple.
- **Provide Varied Descriptions**: Give each image a unique caption to enrich the training data.

**Pro Tip:** Use **Florence 2**, built right into Fluxgym, to automatically generate image captions. It saves time and keeps things consistent. **Just make sure to double-check the captions afterwardâ€”sometimes they might be a bit off!**

---

## Step 3: Setting Up Fluxgym

Let's get Fluxgym up and running:

1. **Install Fluxgym** by following the instructions on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/cocktailpeanut/fluxgym).
2. **Adjust the Settings** to suit your needs:
   - **Learning Rate**: I went with **1e-4 ~ 8e-4**.
   - **Repeat Count**: How many times each image is trained per epoch.
   - **Number of Epochs**: I chose **10**.

Feel free to tweak these settingsâ€”they can affect training time and how well your model performs.

## Step 4: Training Your LoRA

Now for the exciting part!

- **Start Training**: Kick off the process
- **Monitor Progress**: On my 4070 Ti, it took about **1 hour**.
- **Energy Consumption**: Approximately **0.124 kWh**â€”pretty efficient!

## Step 5: Loading into ComfyUI

Time to see your model in action:

- **Load it into ComfyUI**:
- **Generate Some Examples**: Watch your custom model bring your product to life!

*Check the end of this post for GitHub links and the ComfyUI workflow attached.*

I was thrilled to see the rubber duck rendered in various styles and settings. The possibilities are endless!
